React Native Basics Notes

1. Flexbox in RN
   - Layout is flexbox by default.
   - Direction: flexDirection: "column" (items stack top → bottom).
   - Can switch with flexDirection: "row".

2. View
   - Works like a <div> in web.
   - Used as a container for layout.

3. SafeAreaView
   - Keeps content away from notches, status bars, curved edges.
   - Wrap top-level content inside it.

4. JSX Tags
   - Every opening tag needs a closing tag.
   - Example: <Text>Hello</Text>

5. Platform Folders
   - android/ → Native Android code.
   - ios/ → Native iOS code.
   - React Native bridges these via AppRegistry.

6. Appearance Module
   - Lets you check system theme (light/dark mode).
   - Example: Appearance.getColorScheme()

7. useColorScheme Hook
   - React hook for dynamic theming.
   - Example:
     const scheme = useColorScheme();
     const background = scheme === "dark" ? "#000" : "#fff";

8. Styling
   - Styles are written in JavaScript objects (not CSS).
   - Example:
     const styles = StyleSheet.create({
       box: { backgroundColor: "blue", padding: 10 }
     });
